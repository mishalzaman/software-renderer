# Software Renderer

Writing a software renderer which will help me get a better understanding of how graphics APIs like OpengGL and DirectX work. I am aslo fascinated by how graphics are rendered on screen and doing this will be a massive help. I have decided to use a limited amount of third party libraries. For this Software renderer I am currently using the following:

- SDL 2.0 to create a window and draw a pixel
- GLM for vector and matrix calculations 

## Features Added

- Line drawing
- Triange (wireframe / fill) * Needs optimization *
- Import obj file
- Render a mesh file

## Features to Add

- Back face culling
- Z buffer
- Perspective projection
- Camera
- Shaders (fragment / vertex) * This will have to be very limited considering the fact that this is a software renderer
- Improve this readme
